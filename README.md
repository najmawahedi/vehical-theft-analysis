Vehicle Theft Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing vehicle theft data from 2021 and 2022 to uncover patterns, trends, and predictive factors related to vehicle theft incidents. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a logistic regression model for prediction.

Contents
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of vehicle types, models, and temporal patterns in theft incidents.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve the predictive power of the dataset.
Model Building and Evaluation: Developing a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a vehicle being a certain type based on other features.
Summary of Findings: Key insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
Data
